## About Me


Hi 👋 I'm **kyu**, and I'm a software engineer.



I was born in 1997 (you can do the math), in South Korea.
I'm definitely not a hard working type so do check on my github👍. 




Here is the list of things that I do in a day.
* I commit atleast 1 work on github
* I drink atleast 2 cups of coffee
* I plan atleast 4 times on what to have for dinner
* I watch atleast 8 videos from YouTube 
* I speak atleast 16 words in a day (sometimes not)
